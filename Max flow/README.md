# Proseminar: Advanced Algorithms for Competitive Programming

Implementation of various max flow algorithms used in competitive programming. These algorithms were implemented by me, NoÃ«l De Faveri, with the help of various websites, mainly https://cp-algorithms.com for implementations and https://codeforces.com and https://www.wikipedia.org for pseudocodes.

The .dimacs files are all directed graphs generated using the algorithms/gen_flow_net.py script and the pynetgen module. The algorithms have been benchmarked on those graphs.
