# Proseminar: Advanced Algorithms for Competitive Programming

Implementation of various max flow algorithms used in competitive programming. These algorithms were implemented by me with the help of various websites and sources, mainly https://cp-algorithms.com for implementations and https://codeforces.com and https://www.wikipedia.org for pseudocodes.

Reference code used to implement Highest label push relabel + gap heuristic: https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl/blob/main/content/graph/PushRelabel.h

The .dimacs files were all generated using the pynetgen module. (gen_flow_net.py)
